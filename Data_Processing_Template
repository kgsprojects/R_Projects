# DATA PROCESSING TEMPLATE
# Importing the dataset
dataset = read.csv('Salary_Data.csv') # read dataset - set dataset by clicking "more" - "set as working directory"
#dataset = dataset[, 2:3]

# Splitting the dataset into the Training set and Test set
library(caTools) # Select library
set.seed(123)
split = sample.split(dataset$Salary, SplitRatio = 2/3) # Return true or false if set went into training or test
training_set = subset(dataset, split == TRUE)
test_set = subset(dataset, split == FALSE)

#Feature Scaling (if needed)
#training_set = scale(training_set) # used if factors are not used in table
#test_set = scale(test_set) # used if factors are not used in table
# training_set[,2:3] = scale(training_set[,2:3]) #used if factors have been used in table
# test_set[,2:3] = scale(test_set[,2:3]) #used if factors have been used in table
